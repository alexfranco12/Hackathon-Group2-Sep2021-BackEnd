She loves helping kids relax at her Montessori school. She's working on her recall and loves other dogs. We are not sure how she will do with cats. She is ready for her forever home! Everyone needs a virtual learning buddy! Back to school can be a stressful time, especially in this brave new world of e-learning. Studies show that petting a dog can reduce stress and help increase focus. Emerald here is the perfect companion for your small human! Soft and snuggly, she loves nothing more than to curl up next to your little providing moral support during video time and keep their feet warm while they plug away at writing sentences or during live classes. And she's always up for a game a tag or running zoomies during break time! UTD on shots, fixed and (nearly) potty trained Emmie gets along great with other doggos and ADORES the littles.",
